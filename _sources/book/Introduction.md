# LangSim 
The LangSim projects aims to couple Large Language Models with atomistic simulation and provide a Language Simulation 
Engine (LangSim). This project started as part of the [LLM Hackathon for Applications in Materials and Chemistry](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/llm-hackathon-for-applications-in-materials-and-chemistry-tickets-868303598437)
on May 8, 2024 organized by [Benjamin J. Blaiszik](https://github.com/blaiszik) from Argonne 
National Laboratory. The LangSim team was able to [win the first prize](https://medium.com/@blaiszik/llms-to-accelerate-discovery-in-materials-science-and-chemistry-refections-on-a-hackathon-b8364ca32242)
sponsored by [RadicalAI](https://www.radical-ai.com). 

## Winning Submission
The aim of the hackathon was to present a video which demonstrates the functionality of the prototype and highlights the
use case for Large Language Models and their application to materials and chemistry:

LangSim is based on a series of python packages, namely: 
* [ase](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) - Atomic Simulation Environment
* [atomistics](https://atomistics.readthedocs.io) - Simulation protocols to compute material properties
* [EMT](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/emt.html) - Effective Medium Potential
* [langchain](https://www.langchain.com) -  framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs
* [mace](https://mace-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - MACE - Machine Learning Force Fields
* [mendeleev](https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io) - API for accessing various properties of elements from the periodic table of elements
